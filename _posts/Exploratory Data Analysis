There are 6 principles( Edward Tufts: Beautiful Evidence) talks about when describing Exploratory data .
1st Principle: Show comparisons  "comparsions to what?"
2nd Principle: Show Causality, mechanism, explanations,systematic Structure
3rd Principle: Show multivariate data
4th Principle: Integration of evidence "Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation"
Principle 4: Integration of evidence
       Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
      Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
     Don't let the tool drive the analysis
Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.
- A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible
Principle 6: content is King
   Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and
integrity of their content
