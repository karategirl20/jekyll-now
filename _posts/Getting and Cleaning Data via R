using Dplyr package:Dplyr is a fast and powerful R package written by Hadley  Wickham 
and Romain Francois that provides a consistent and concise grammar for manipulating tabular data.
install(dplyr) then do a library(dplyr) in R studio console - to load the package again.
type packageVersion("dplyr") in R studio console to find the version of the Dplyr package.
dim()-dim() to look at the dimensions of a data frame, file etc.
The first step of working with data in dplyr is to load the data into what the package authors call a 
'data frame tbl' or 'tbl_df'. tbl_df {dplyr}
Use the following code to create a new tbl_df called cran
Example: cran <- tbl_df(mydf).
To remove a dataframe that we created earlier: remove the original data frame workspace with rm("mydf").
Specifically, dplyr supplies five 'verbs' that cover most fundamental data manipulation tasks:
 select(), filter(), arrange(), mutate(), and summarize().
Example when using select(cran,ip_id,package,country), we do not need to use $
we don't have to type cran$ip_id, cran$package, and | cran$country, as we normally would when referring to 
columns of a data frame. The select() function knows we are referring to columns of the cran dataset.
select(cran, r_arch:country)
select(cran, country:r_arch) selects the same columns in reverse order. 
To omit a certain variable from dataset you can use  "-"
select(cran, -time) to omit the time column.
