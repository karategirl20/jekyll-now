layout: Tidy dataset
title: Tidy dataset
Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. By Henry Wickham. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations,variables and types. In tidy data:
1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table!
Wickham developed the reshape and reshape2 (Wickham 2007) packages to help with Tidying a dataset.
